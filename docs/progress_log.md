# Stem Checker MVP: Progress Log

This document tracks the development progress of the Stem Checker MVP.

## Phase 1: Core Prototype

### 1. Project Setup
- **Date:** 2025-09-04
- **Action:** Created a new macOS application project in Xcode named `StemChecker`.
- **Configuration:**
  - **Interface:** SwiftUI
  - **Language:** Swift
  - **Target:** macOS

### 2. Core Audio Engine (`AudioEngine.swift`)
- **Purpose:** To handle all audio-related logic, ensuring that multiple audio files can be played back in perfect synchronization.
- **Key Components:**
  - **`AVAudioEngine`:** The underlying Apple framework used for complex audio tasks.
  - **`AVAudioPlayerNode`:** An array of nodes, each responsible for playing one audio file.
  - **`AVAudioFile`:** An array holding the loaded audio file data.
- **Functions:**
  - `load(urls: [URL])`: Clears any existing audio, loads a new set of files from their URLs, and prepares the engine for playback.
  - `play()`: Schedules all loaded files to play simultaneously.
  - `stop()`: Stops and resets all player nodes so they are ready to play again from the beginning.

### 3. Prototype User Interface (`ContentView.swift`)
- **Purpose:** To provide a simple window for testing the core functionality of the `AudioEngine`.
- **Features:**
  - **Load Stems Button:** Opens a system file dialog to allow the user to select multiple audio files (`.wav`, `.aiff`, etc.).
  - **File List:** Displays the names of the files that have been loaded.
  - **Play/Stop Buttons:** Controls to start and stop the synchronized audio playback.

### Current Status
As of this document's creation, the prototype is fully functional. It can successfully load multiple audio files, play them in sync, and stop/replay them correctly. The initial bug related to re-playing audio after stopping has been resolved. The application is now ready for the next phase: Finder integration.

## Phase 2: Finder Integration

### 1. Initial Attempts (Action Extension)
- **Date:** 2025-09-07
- **Action:** Attempted to create a Finder Quick Action using a native Xcode Action Extension target.
- **Result:** This approach was abandoned after extensive troubleshooting revealed a fundamental bug in Apple's Xcode templates, which incorrectly linked against iOS-only frameworks (`UIKit`) and caused the extension to fail silently.

### 2. Successful Implementation (Automator Quick Action)
- **Date:** 2025-09-08
- **Action:** Created a robust Finder integration using a macOS Automator Quick Action.
- **Workflow:**
  - The Automator action is configured to receive audio files from Finder.
  - It runs a shell script that copies the selected files into a shared App Group container.
  - The script then launches the main `StemChecker` application.
  - The application's `AppDelegate` detects the files in the shared container upon launch, loads them into the `AudioEngine`, and presents them to the user.
- **Status:** The Finder integration is now fully functional, achieving the primary goal of the MVP. The application can be launched directly from a right-click in Finder with the selected stems loaded automatically.
